# Open Graph Plugin for Omeka

A plugin to include [Open Graph Card](http://ogp.me/) tags on [Omeka](http://omeka.org/) pages.

Open Graph cards tags are added to Exhibit, Collection Item and File pages for records that include dc.title and dc.description metadata. For Items with a file that has a thumbnail, a thumbnail image URL is added.  For Exhibits and Collections, the URL representative thumbnail image is used.  For other pages, the site title and description are used, along with an image URL from a random featured Item.

Based on the [Twitter and Open Graph Cards plugin](https://github.com/ezanon/omeka-twitter-opengraph-cards-plugin) by [ezanon](https://github.com/ezanon).
