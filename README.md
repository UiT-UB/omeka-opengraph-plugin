# Twitter Cards Plugin for Omeka

A plugin to include [Twitter Card](https://dev.twitter.com/cards) tags on [Omeka](http://omeka.org/) pages.  

Tags for Twitter Card summary cards are added to Exhibit, Collection and Item pages for records that include dc.title and dc.description metadata. For Items with a file that has a thumbnail, a thumbnail image URL is added.  Item metadata takes precedent over Exhibit metadata if an Item is viewed from an Exhibit. For other pages, the site title and description are used.

## Configuration

Set a Twitter handle for your site on the plugin configuration form.  For the Twitter Card information to be usable, [apply for and validate your summary card with Twitter](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/validation/validator).
